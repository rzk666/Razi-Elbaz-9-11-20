## Notes
**Total Time: 22.5 Hours**
* Full report via WakaTime: https://ibb.co/KDTKsQm
* This project took me this long because I also explained a friend of mine a lot of was I was doing as part of volenterally teaching him programming in the past few months after he lost his job due to the COVID-19 situation. (By the way, if you need a solid(!) React junior and a really great guy I personally trained for the past couple of months... let me know! :wink: )
* I also used material ui pretty much for the first time other then in toy apps, I usually use Semantic-UI, that probably also added an extra hour of two :D
